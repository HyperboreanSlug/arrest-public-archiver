"""Ensure DeepFace (local race model) is installed and ready.

Called automatically when mugshot scoring starts with backend auto/deepface.
Installs from ``requirements-vision.txt`` into the current interpreter, then
optionally warms the race model (downloads weights to ``~/.deepface/weights/``).

Hardening:
  * pip always targets *this* process's site-packages (pythonw → python.exe)
  * cross-process file lock so two GUIs cannot fight over WinError 32
  * retries on file-lock / permission pip failures
  * detects numpy ABI mismatches and force-repairs the vision stack
  * sets TF_USE_LEGACY_KERAS so RetinaFace works with TF 2.16+/Keras 3
