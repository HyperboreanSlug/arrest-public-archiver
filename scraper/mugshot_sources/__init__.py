"""Registry and multi-host orchestrator for mugshot HTML sources.

Sources similar to RecentlyBooked / Busted Newspaper:
  - recentlybooked.com  — multi-state county booking pages
  - mugshots.com        — multi-state county booking pages (implemented)
  - bustednewspaper.com — currently SSL-blocked (registered as unavailable)

When multiple sources cover the same county/person, the orchestrator:
  1. Partitions work units (state/county) across available hosts (round-robin)
  2. Shares a cross-host identity index so detail pages for the same person
     are only fetched from one host
  3. Runs sources in parallel threads so load is split rather than stacked
